I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Visvesvaraya Technological University, where I built my foundation in programming and systems thinking.

- 📍 I'm based in Texas and open to full-time opportunities across the U.S. in data analytics, business intelligence, and data engineering.

- 🏢 Over the past 3+ years, I’ve gained diverse experience working across education, retail, and consulting organizations:

  - **Wyzmindz Solutions**: As a Business Data Analyst, I contributed to ETL automation and dashboard development. I worked with tools such as Informatica, Python, Power BI, Looker (LookML), Google Analytics, and SQL to support marketing and operations teams.

  - **Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail**: During my internship, I explored pricing and segmentation strategies through POS data analysis. I used Tableau, Excel, SQL, and Python (Scikit-learn) to uncover insights and deliver dashboards for inventory and campaign planning.

  - **Amara Raja Group**: In this internship, I worked on supply chain and operations data using SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python to improve visibility and streamline procurement reporting across manufacturing functions.

- 🧠 My academic and professional background has equipped me with hands-on experience in the complete data lifecycle—from ETL development and data modeling to dashboarding and analytics storytelling.
